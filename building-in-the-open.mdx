During the alpha period, you can explore the Towns [smart contracts](/smart-contracts) and app. You can experiment locally to learn about the protocol.

In later releases of Towns, youâ€™ll be able to:

Contribute to the source code for nodes, contracts, and clients

- Develop your own client
- Request and vote on features
- Participate in bug bounties
- We believe in building in the open. These docs will be updated regularly as Towns evolves.

Build the Town you want to live in!
